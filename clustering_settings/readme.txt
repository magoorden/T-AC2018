The data in this folder is structured as follows.

The files LockIII_ClusSettings.txt and
LockIII_ClusSettings_extended.txt contain the clustering settings.
The files LockIII_dataClusAlg.txt and
LockIII_dataClusAlg_extended.txt contain the sum of the state space
sizes of the synthesized supervisors.

Clustering settings on row i correspond to clustering result on row
i.

Row i in the clustering settings contain (in order) the values for
alpha, beta, and mu. Row i in the clustering results contain (in
order) the sum of the state space sizes of the synthesized
supervisors and whether they are blocking (1 = blocking, 0 =
nonblocking).
