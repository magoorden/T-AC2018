CIF models used in the T-AC 2018 paper

Compatible with CIF version r9682, downloaded from: http://cif.se.wtb.tue.nl/

Specific tooling for automatic clustering and generating all supervisors for 
MLDES are not yet publicly available.

The map simple_lock contains the model of the simple lock that is used as a 
running example in Section IV of the paper.

The map benchmark_models contains all the models used for to obtain the experimental
results presented in Section V of the paper. 

The map clustering_settings contains the data after applying multilevel
supervisory synthesis for different clustering parameters.

The map nonconflicting contains the adjusted model with conflicing requirement.

The map benchmark_test contains the data after applying multilevel supervisory
synthesis for all benchmark models.
